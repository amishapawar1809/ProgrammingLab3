		<h3>A Challenging and Rewarding Career</h3>
		<p style="font-size: 18px;">The thrill you get from completing a serious challenge is a feat wished by many, but experienced by few. Computer science offers that opportunity to not only challenge yourself, but feel a great sense of accomplishment after every successful coding session. In a world full of problems, becoming a problem solver is a pretty safe bet.</p>

		<h3>A Fulfilling Career</h3>
		<p style="font-size: 18px;">Students often choose their majors based on variety of reasons â€“ including the career outlook in terms of monetary gain and mental well-being. Computer science offers both. According to ACM, computing jobs are among the highest paid and have the highest job satisfaction. Moreover, in the United States, there are more programming jobs than there are available programmers. According to the US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of computer programmers is projected to grow 8 percent from 2012 to 2022.</p>
